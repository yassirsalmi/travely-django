# Travely: Travel and Hotel Reservations Project

## Description:
Travely is a project designed to make booking travel and hotel stays easier. It's a school assignment where students create a website that helps people plan and reserve travel. Travely gives travelers a simple tool to browse different trip options, book hotels, and keep track of their travel plans.

## Status:
Travely is being actively developed as an academic project. We are continuously working to improve its functionality, ease of use, and overall features. While substantial progress has been achieved, some aspects still need refinement and further development.

## Features:

- User-friendly interface for browsing travel destinations.
- Search functionality to find available hotels based on location, dates, and preferences.
- Secure user authentication and account management.
- Booking system for reserving hotel rooms.
- Profile management to view and modify travel itineraries.
